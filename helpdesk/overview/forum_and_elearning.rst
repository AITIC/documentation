Forum
=====

Phone lines, email support, and live chat are all necessary for excellent customer service, but
adding a support forum can improve satisfaction rates and build a loyal community. A forum
encourages customer engagement, knowledge sharing, and brand trust. By providing a space for
questions and conversation, you'll learn valuable information for your business, and your
customers will be happier.

eLearning
=========

In addition to a forum, online courses can help improve your customer experience and save
valuable time. Your customers can find answers themselves with tutorials, and your support team
can send links to useful content rather than writing out lengthy emails.
